# python_api_challenge
Background


Before You Begin


Create a new repository for this project called python-api-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.


Clone the new repository to your computer.


Inside the directory for both other Python api challenges I  used a folder name WeatherPy.


Inside the folder both files WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.





Adding a .gitignore File
I don't want the api_keys.py file containing the API key to be exposed to the public on GitHub; this would mean anyone could copy and use our API key, possibly incurring charges.
When we type git status in the command line, we can see all the untracked files that we have created so far.
If we only wanted to add the WeatherPy.ipynb file to GitHub, we could type git add WeatherPy.ipynb. However, every time we want to add a new file or update current files to the repository, we would have to add each file individually, which is time-consuming and cumbersome. Instead, we can add the files that we don't want to track to the .gitignore file.
Before we add our files to GitHub, let's add api_keys.py to the .gitignore file. Use the following instructions:


Open your python-api-challenge GitHub folder in VS Code.


Open the .gitignore file, and on the first line, type the following code:



# Adding config.py file.
api_keys.py




While the .gitignore file is open, add the API_practice.ipynb and random_numbers.ipynb files and save the file.


In the command line, type git status and press Enter. The output should indicate that the .gitignore file has been modified and the WeatherPy.ipynb file is untracked.


Use git add, git commit, and git push to commit the modifications to .gitignore and the WeatherPy.ipynb file to GitHub.


On GitHub, the file  is the WeatherPy.ipynb file.

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this section, you'll create a Python script to visualise the weather of 500+ cities of varying distance from the equator. To do so, you'll use a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.
The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (C) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude

After each plot, add a sentence or two explaining what the code is analysing.
The second requirement is to compute the linear regression for each relationship. This time, separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (C) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (C) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots, explain what the linear regression is modelling. For example, describe any relationships that you notice and any other findings you may have.
Your final notebook must:

Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeated) cities based on latitude and longitude.
Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
Include a print log of each city as it's being processed, with the city number and city name.
Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.


Part 2: VacationPy
Now, let's use your skills working with weather data to plan future vacations. Use Jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.


Note: Remember that any API usage beyond the $200 credit will be charged to your personal account. You can set quotas and limits to your daily requests to be sure you can't be charged. Check out Google Maps Platform Billing and Manage your cost of use for more information.


Note: If you are having trouble displaying the maps, run jupyter nbextension enable --py gmaps in your environment and then retry.


To complete this part of the assignment, you will need to do the following:


Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part 1, as in the following image:



Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:


A max temperature lower than 30 degrees but higher than 20.


Wind speed less than 5 m/s.


Zero cloudiness.


Drop any rows that don't satisfy all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.







Use Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5,000 metres of your coordinates.


Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap, with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country, as in the following image:



As final considerations:

You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
For Part 1,  include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
For Part 2,include  a screenshot of the heatmap that is created using the program.
All plots  include labelling aspects like plot title (with date of analysis) and axis labels.
For max intensity in the heatmap, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the dataset.


Hints and Considerations


The city data that you generate is based on random coordinates and different query times, so your outputs will not be an exact match to the provided starter notebook.


If you'd like a refresher on the geographic coordinate system, this site has great information.


Next, take some time to study the OpenWeatherMap API. Based on your initial study, you should be able to answer basic questions about the API: Where do you request the API key? Which Weather API in particular will you need? What URL endpoints does it expect? What JSON structure does it respond with? Before you write a line of code, you should have a crystal-clear understanding of your intended outcome.


A starter code for citipy has been provided. However, if you're craving an extra challenge, push yourself to learn how it works: citipy Python library. Before you try to incorporate the library in your analysis, start with simple test cases outside your main script to confirm that you are using it correctly. Often, when introduced to a new library, students will spend hours trying to figure out errors in their codeâ€”a simple test case can save you a lot of time and frustration.


You will need to apply your critical thinking skills to understand how and why we're recommending the tools we are. What is citipy used for? Why would you use it in conjunction with the OpenWeatherMap API? How would you do so?


While building your script, pay attention to the cities you are using in your query pool. Are you covering the full range of latitudes and longitudes? Or are you choosing 500 cities from one region of the world? Even if you were a geography genius, simply listing 500 cities based on your personal selection would create a biased dataset. Try to think of ways that you can counter this.
